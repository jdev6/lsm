,this was made to demonstrate how to replicate a loop
,prints all odd numbers between 0 and 50

def @max 50;
def @num 0;

>loop;
add @num 1 @num; ,increase current value
gt @num @max; ,if we reached the max number quit
&goto >end;

mod @num 2 @tmpnum; ,perform module division between num and 2 and put result into tmpnum

eq @tmpnum 1; ,if it  isn't an odd number start the loop again
!goto >loop;

sput @num "\n"; ,print number if it's odd
goto >loop;

>end;
sput "end!\n";
